        <p>This is from Jonathan Harris’s insightful, instructive, inspirational essay, <a href="http://transom.org/2014/jonathan-harris/">Navigating Unstuckness</a>. I view it as a guiding principle for my own life, in the decisions I choose to make and the people and things I give my attention to. Like Jonathan, when I was ten I was writing stories and drawing pictures. In a way, this blog is my way to get back to what I was doing then.</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>All we have in life is our time. People struggle after success. They hunger for fame, fortune, and power. But in all of these things, the same question exists — what will you do with your time? How do you want to spend your days? As Annie Dillard reminds us, “how we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives.”</p>
  </blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>In life, you will become known for doing what you do. That sounds obvious, but it’s profound. If you want to be known as someone who does a particular thing, then you must start doing that thing immediately. Don’t wait. There is no other way. It probably won’t make you money at first, but do it anyway. Work nights. Work weekends. Sleep less. Whatever you have to do. If you’re lucky enough to know what brings you bliss, then do that thing at once. If you do it well, and for long enough, the world will find ways to repay you.</p>

    <p>This fall, in a toilet stall in Burlington, Vermont, I saw this scrawled on the wall:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“Don’t ask yourself what the world needs. Ask yourself what makes you come alive. The world needs more people who have come alive.”</p>
  </blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>If you’re doing something you love, you won’t care what the world thinks, because you’ll love the process anyway. This is one of those truths that we know, but which we can’t seem to stop forgetting.</p>
  </blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>In America, success is a word we hear a lot. What does it mean? Is it money, power, fame, love? I like how Bob Dylan defines it: “A man is a success if he gets up in the morning and gets to bed at night, and in between he does what he wants to do.”</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>We have these brief lives, and our only real choice is how we will fill them. Your attention is precious. Don’t squander it. Don’t throw it away. Don’t let companies and products steal it from you. Don’t let advertisers trick you into lusting after things you don’t need. Don’t let the media convince you to covet the lives of celebrities. Own your attention — it’s all you really have.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>In the tradeoff between timeliness and timelessness, choose the latter. The zeitgeist rewards timeliness, but your soul rewards timelessness. Work on things that will last.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Inside each of us is a little ten-year-old child, curious and pure, acting on impulse, not yet caring what other people think. Remember what you were doing at ten, and try to get back to doing that thing, incorporating everything you’ve learned along the way.</p>
